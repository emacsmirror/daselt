;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains maps for maps used in icicles. If daselt-icicles is t, it is parsed automatically when daselt-mode is started or icicles is evaluated, depending on what comes first. Each element in this file should be a minor mode.

;;; Code:

;; (defvar-keymap d-emacs-icicle-minibuffer-mode-map)
;; ;; (defvar-keymap d-emacs-completion-list-emulation-mode-map)
