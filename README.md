# D-Emacs
This package is Daselt's [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) module. It consists of several parts:

- `d-emacs-coords` provides functions to for coordinatized layouts.

- `d-emacs-xkb` can import custom [xkb](https://www.x.org/wiki/XKB/)-layouts into Emacs.

- `d-emacs-dfk` can generate [Dual Function Keys](https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/dual-function-keys) configurations from coordinates
  and add them to layouts as a zeroth layer.

- `d-emacs-bind` allows Emacs to read bindings that use coordinates and store
  and manipulate them in bindlists.

- `d-emacs-dirs` provides functions to recursively act on files in a directory
  and automatically apply actions on file save.

- `d-emacs-mode` provides a mode that implements Daselt's shortcut layout in
  Emacs.

- `d-emacs-stump` can generate [StumpWM](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm/wiki) configurations from bindlists.

- `d-emacs-tri` can generate [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) configurations from bindlists.
